# BUKttr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of BUKttr is to enable graduate students write their theses/dissertations in an efficient manner using the integrated development environment of R and RStudio.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BUKttr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Tijjanims/BUKttr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(BUKttr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
